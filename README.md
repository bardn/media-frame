- A TMDb API key (for movie/show details)

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and configure the system.

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/media-frame.git
cd media-frame

2. Install dependencies

Use pip to install the required Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up the .env file

Copy the .env.example file to .env and configure the necessary API keys and credentials.

cp .env.example .env

Edit the .env file with your Spotify, Trakt, and TMDb credentials:

# Spotify API credentials
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
SPOTIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_spotify_access_token
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_spotify_refresh_token

# Trakt API credentials
TRAKT_USERNAME=your_trakt_username
TRAKT_CLIENT_ID=your_trakt_client_id
TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_trakt_client_secret
TRAKT_REDIRECT_URI=your_trakt_redirect_uri

# TMDb API key
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key

# OAuth tokens (these will be populated after successful OAuth process)
TRAKT_ACCESS_TOKEN=
TRAKT_REFRESH_TOKEN=

# MQTT
MQTT_BROKER=mqtt_broker_local_ip
MQTT_PORT=mqtt_broker_port_number
MQTT_TOPIC=homeassistant/matrix/brightness

    Replace your_spotify_client_id, your_spotify_client_secret, etc., with your actual API credentials.

4. Set up the Trakt OAuth tokens

Run the setup.py script to authenticate with Trakt and obtain the necessary OAuth tokens:

python setup.py

This will guide you through the process of authenticating with Trakt and will save your TRAKT_ACCESS_TOKEN and TRAKT_REFRESH_TOKEN to the .env file for future use.
5. Run the application

Once everything is set up, run the application:

python main.py

6. Run as a background service (Optional)

To automatically start the system as a background service on boot, you can use the setup.sh script. This script installs dependencies, sets up the .env file, runs the setup process, and installs the systemd service.

Run the setup.sh script:

./setup.sh

This will guide you through the entire process and install a background service for the application. Once set up, the system will start automatically on boot and run in the background.
7. Checking the service status

If you installed the system as a background service, you can check its status using the following command:

sudo systemctl status media-frame.service
